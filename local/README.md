# Flashcard Application
The 'Flashcard' Application allows the user to create, view, and edit flashcards and decks, respectively. The decks are a collection of flashcards and the user can create as many decks as they want. The creation of the decks allows the user to easily go to a certain topic they want to study. Note that the data store for this APP is provided by the [Json-Server](  https://www.javatpoint.com/json-server#:~:text=JSON%20Server%20is%20a%20Node,Let'), which runs concurrently with the 'Flashcard' client.
